VERSION HISTORY
---------------

Version: 0.4
Date: 2023-12-26 (yyyy-mm-dd)
License: BSD Zero Clause License (as written in the file fwall.sh). 

Status: this is the initial version.
Todo: add support for IPv6 (this script is IPv4 only at the moment). 


-----
USAGE
-----

The purpose of this script is to configure the iptables firewall so that it
forwards traffic to the other side of the GRE tunnel.

This script is intended for use on a VPS (but should work with other
scenarios as well). This script has been tested with Debian GNU/Linux 12 on
a VPS hosted at STRATO. Please adjust the variables between "BEGIN SETTINGS"
and "END   SETTINGS" (the variables should be self-explanatory).

NOTES
-----

These are notes which might be helpful.

The following additonal packages where installed on my test VPS:
iproute2, crontab, net-tools, dnsutils, fail2ban, tcpdump, mc, nano

This script is being executed on boot with cron on my test VPS:
@reboot /opt/scripts/fwall.sh

The GRE tunnel was initally added with the following three commands:
[1] ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre remote 77.xxx.yyy.155 local 217.xxx.yyy.27 ttl 255
[2] ip link set gre1 up
[3] ip addr add 172.30.250.2/29 dev gre1

The above three lines will not survive a reboot... thus I did add the tunnel to (which is the standard file on the VPS I use for testing):
/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

The six lines are:
   tunnels:
       gre1:
           mode: gre
           local: 217.xxx.yyy.27
           remote: 77.xxx.yyy.155
           addresses: [172.30.250.2/29]

Note: I did remove cloud-init:
   touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled
   dpkg-reconfigure cloud-init
   apt-get purge cloud-init
   rm -rf /etc/cloud/ && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/
   reboot
